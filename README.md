## ðŸŽ® Games
Here you will find assets and code of three of my games:
  - [Legend of Damacuri](https://leticiafidelix.itch.io/legend-of-damacuri): A tribe of women in a forest, when rejected by the Sun God, decided to seek a new home.
  - [Supercharger](https://henrique-moraes.itch.io/supercharger): Charge the superchargers and run to the finish line!
  - [Dice Warriors](https://henrique-moraes.itch.io/dice-warriors-alpha-version): A RPG where the dice are the characters.

## ðŸ“ƒ My Code
I worked with another programmer in Legend of Damacuri. In this specific project, I was responsible for the prototype and for the final build.

All the code in Supercharger and Dice Warriors is mine.
