# henrique-s-projects
A repository of some projects' assets and code.

## ðŸŽ® Games
Here you will find assets and code of three of my games:
  - Legend of Damacuri: A tribe of women in a forest, when rejected by the Sun God, decided to seek a new home.
  - Supercharger: Charge the superchargers and run to the finish line!
  - Dice Warriors: A RPG where the dice are the characters.

## ðŸ“ƒ My Code
I worked with another programmer in Legend of Damacuri. In this specific project, I was responsible for the prototype and for the final build.
All the code in Supercharger and Dice Warriors is mine.
